# TTD

## Exercise 1:
Solution available [here](https://github.com/sarlijes/TDD/tree/master/tdd-mooc-tetris)

## Exercise 2:
First attempt for a solution available [here](https://github.com/sarlijes/TDD/blob/1-refactor/tdd-mooc-small-steps/src/prices.mjs) - note the feature branch - implemented by first creating parallel `if` logic depending on the type of the date (by using `instanceof`) and removing the original logic after converting to new `Temporal.PlainDate` class.

Second iteration [here](https://github.com/sarlijes/TDD/blob/2-refactor/tdd-mooc-small-steps/src/prices.mjs) - by creating paraller functions, then taking them into use and then removing the old, now dead functions.
